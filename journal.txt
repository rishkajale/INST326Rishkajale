Rish Kajale Week 1 AI Journal
This week I used AI to help me with some syntax questions that I had as I am learning python. 
I also asked AI to help me use the VS Code app about some questions that I had about how to do some basic things.
AI also assisted me with debugging some of my code. 
I used AI for some specific questions about the excersise for something I didnt know how to do. 
I used the AI which was in the VS code I will paste some of my questions here.

how to use f string

An f-string in Python is a way to format strings using curly braces {} to insert variables or expressions directly into the string. You create an f-string by prefixing the string with the letter f.

how to make ure i dont get negative amount in arithmatic

To ensure you don‚Äôt get a negative amount in arithmetic (for example, when calculating a late fee), use the max() function to keep the value at least zero.

For your code, you should:

Convert the input to an integer correctly.
Use max() to make sure days_late is not negative.
Example fix:



how do i save and export this whole thing

To save your notebook, just click the save icon (üíæ) or press Cmd+S (on Mac) while the notebook is open in VS Code.

To export your notebook:

Open the notebook in VS Code.
Click the ‚ÄúExport‚Äù button at the top right (it may look like an arrow or say ‚ÄúExport‚Äù).
Choose your format (e.g., PDF, HTML, or Python script).
Follow the prompts to save the exported file.
Your notebook will be saved and exported in the format you choose.

WEEK 2 AI JOURNAL
This week I used AI to help me with loops. I maily used the assistance of AI to help me learn and refine my skills with for loops. 
how do i use for loops in python
ChatGPT said:

In Python, a for loop is used to iterate over a sequence like a list, tuple, string, or range. Here's the basic syntax and a few common examples:

I also needed assistance with some syntax questions that I had. 
index in lists
ChatGPT said:

In Python, you can access elements in a list by their index. Indexing starts at 0, so the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.

üî¢ Accessing Items by Index
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

print(my_list[0])  # Output: 'a'
print(my_list[2])  # Output: 'c'

WEEK 3 AI JOURNAL
This week i used Ai to help me learn functions and more about indexes
I knew the basic but AI explained it more to me to help me understand it and use it

AI said
Indexes in Python are how you access elements in sequences like lists, strings, or tuples. Let me break it down step by step:

1. Basic idea

Each element in a sequence has a number (its index) starting from 0.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # apple
print(fruits[1])  # banana
print(fruits[2])  # cherry


fruits[0] ‚Üí first element

fruits[1] ‚Üí second element

fruits[2] ‚Üí third element

Explain this function:
AI saidL
The function validate_record(title, author) ensures that both the title and author are meaningful strings, not just empty or whitespace-only inputs. It first uses .strip() on each string to remove any leading or trailing spaces, because spaces alone don‚Äôt count as valid content. Then it checks whether each stripped string is non-empty. Only if both strings contain actual characters does the function return True; otherwise, it returns False. This is useful for validating data before adding it to a library or database, preventing entries with missing or blank information from being saved.




WEEK 4 AI JOUNRAL
this week I asked Ai to help me with classes.
I also asked Ai to help me to debug certain errors
A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of a class. Classes let you group data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together.
Think of it like this:
Class ‚Üí blueprint of a car
Object ‚Üí a specific car you own
Attributes ‚Üí color, make, model of the car
Methods ‚Üí start(), stop(), honk()
2. Basic syntax
class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2):
        self.attribute1 = attribute1
        self.attribute2 = attribute2

    def method1(self):
        # code for behavior
        pass
